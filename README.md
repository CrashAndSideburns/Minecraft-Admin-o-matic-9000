# Minecraft Admin-o-matic 9000
The Minecraft Admin-o-matic is a Discord bot written with the discord.py framework, meant to enable your Discord server to interface with your Minecraft server in a multitude of ways.
## Installation
Currently the only way to use the Minecraft Admin-o-matic 9000 securely is to clone the repo to your personal computer, and run it as the code for your own bot, with its own secret key. The bot's secret ket must be stored as BOT_TOKEN in /.env. You'll also need to create an empty .json file called data.json.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/CrashAndSideburns/Minecraft-Admin-o-matic-9000.git
$ python Minecraft-Admin-o-matic-9000/bot.py
```
## Usage
It barely works. Don't get your hopes up. If you have any problems, the best course of action is probably to either contact me directly or give up.
